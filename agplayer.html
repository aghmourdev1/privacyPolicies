  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>AGHMOUR DEV</strong> built the <strong>AGPLAYER</strong> app as a Free application. This Service is provided by AGHMOUR DEV at no cost and is intended for use “as is”.</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we handle personal data in compliance with the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> and other applicable EU laws. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not directly collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information.</strong></p>
  <p>However, the app integrates with trusted third-party services that may collect limited information automatically (e.g., device identifiers, crash logs, or advertising identifiers) to provide and improve functionality.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app may rely on the following services, which have their own privacy policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app may request access to photos, videos, or media stored on your device solely for the purpose of enabling playback functionality. These files remain on your device, and we do not copy, store, or transmit them to our servers.</p>

  <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
  <p>We do not use cookies or tracking technologies directly. Some third-party services (e.g., AdMob) may use cookies or identifiers to deliver ads or analytics. You may manage or disable cookies in your device settings.</p>
  <h2>Service Providers</h2>
  <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
  <ul>
        <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
        <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
        <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
        <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our services are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them. If you believe your child has provided data, please contact us, and we will delete it immediately.</p>
  <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
  <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights Under GDPR</h2>
  <p>If you are located in the European Union, you have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The right to access, correct, or delete your data.</li>
    <li>The right to restrict or object to processing.</li>
    <li>The right to data portability.</li>
    <li>The right to withdraw consent where applicable.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Since we do not directly collect personal data, any requests must be directed to the relevant third-party provider (e.g., Google, Firebase).</p>

 
  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data handled through third-party services. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.</p>

  <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: 25 September 2025</p>
